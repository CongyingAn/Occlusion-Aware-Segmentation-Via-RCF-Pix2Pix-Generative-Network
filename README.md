# Occlusion-Aware-Segmentation-Via-RCF-Pix2Pix-Generative-Network
 we propose a segmentation method, RCF-Pix2Pix, that enhances the ability to perceive boundary information concerning occlusion issues. It mimics human capabilities to enhance the prediction of occluded areas based on target edges and overall shape.
